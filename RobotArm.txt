Desires:
	6 degrees of freedom
	a decent weight capacity (light but sturdy arm)
	decent reach
	smooth quiet motion
	decent precision
	decent accuracy
	





6 DoF arm:
    Base rotation
    Shoulder pitch
    Elbow pitch
    Wrist pitch
    Wrist yaw
    Wrist roll / gripper rotation


Frame Material:
	3D printer stuff
	Carbon fibre rod/tube


Motors:
	Joints:
		Harmonic Drive Servos
		NEMA 17/23 Stepper Motors
		planetary gearboxes
		encoders
	Wrist:
		


Software (i will worry about this later):
	Inverse Kinematics using Python
	Controlled with web GUI
	Torque limits, Joint limiters, smooth acceleration



Motor Ideas:

	Base Yaw: 
	(Requirements: high torque, good precision)
		Motor:				NEMA 23 Stepper
		Transmission:	Planetary Gearbox 20:1 (Good balance of torque and backlash)
								large diameter thrust bearing (stability)
		Encoder:			Magnetic rotary encoders

	Shoulder Pitch: 
	(Requirements: most important, load bearing joint, high torque, zero backlash, accuracy)
		Motor:				NEMA 23 Closed-loop stepper
		Transmission:	Harmonic Drive 1:100 or 1:50
								thrust bearing
		Encoder:			Integrated with closed loop driver

	Elbow Pitch:
	(Requirements: decent load, light)
		Motor:				NEMA 17 Stepper
		Transmission:	Planetary Gearbox 20:1
								thrust bearing
		Belt: 				Belt drive (Remote motor placement lowers weight distance)
		Encoder:			AMT102/103 or magnetic encoder
	
	Wrist Pitch:
	(Requirements: lower torque, high precision)
		Motor:				NEMA 17 Stepper (compact, high precision model)
		Transmission:	Planetary Gearbox 10:1
		Encoder:			maybe for closed loop
		
	Wrist Yaw:
	(Requirements: small, light, speed, precision)
		Motor: 				NEMA 17 + 10:1 gearbox
						OR	High torque digital servo
		Transmission:	Internal / small gear

	Wrist Roll / Gripper Rotation:
	(Requirements: small, light, speed, precision)
		Motor: 				High speed DC gearmotor or servo
		Transmission:	Internal
